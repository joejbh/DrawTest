A block swapping game with the goal of lining up three or more blocks in a row.  

This Demo Showcases: 
Animating simple movement and explosions, Custom SurfaceViews â€“ reusable in XML, Playing Audio Media, Detecting groupings of blocks with Recursive Functions, Interpreting Swiping Input and the number of fingers used during input, Managing varying Screen Sizes.

A particular benefit of making the SurfaceView reusable in XML is that it can be placed inside of other layouts thereby permitting things other than the SurfaceView to appear on the screen.  Thus we wouldn't be forced to animate a scoreboard, but could use a TextView instead.
